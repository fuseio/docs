Welcome to the go-to portal for in-depth information about the Fuse Network \(Fuse\) platform and ecosystem and how to interact with them!

The Fuse documentation is separated into three major parts:

**1.** **General**. This part is for anyone who wants to learn more about Fuse without going into detail that only developers would usually need to know.

**2.** **Technical Docs.** Developers wishing to build on top of Fuse Network and its mobile-centric infrastructure or run validator nodes should consult this part. 

**3. Tutorials.** This part contains various consumer-focused tutorials. ****
