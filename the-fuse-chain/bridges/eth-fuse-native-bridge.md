# ETH â†” Fuse Native Bridge

Fuse native bridge between Ethereum and Fuse is used to relay the Fuse native token from Fuse to Ethereum network



We have two bridges as explained below

1. Fuse Bridge:  ****The bridge, based on POA's bridge implementation, is used to transfer Fuse tokens between the Fuse chain and the Ethereum network.
2. ERC20 token bridge: This bridge is used to transfer ERC20 tokens into Fuse chain and back. Please not that Fuse bridge is not supposed to be used to transfer  . 

The bridge, based on POA's bridge implementation, is used to transfer Fuse tokens between the Fuse chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Fuse or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender.

The validators of the bridge on both network are the Fuse chain validators. This means that validators, as part of their governance responsibilities, also need to validate bridge transactions and therefore hold Fuse tokens to "approve" bridge transactions on Fuse chain and hold ETH to "approve" transactions on Ethereum.

Each bridge transaction must be approved by a majority \(over 50%\) of the validators in order to be processed successfully.

The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Fuse tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events:

## How to use

On Fuse Network you send native Fuse token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Fuse token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Fuse token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Fuse native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
