## Partnerships and integrations

### [Ramp Network](https://ramp.network)

Ramp Network is a leading global provider of fiat on- and off-ramp solutions for crypto projects. Fuse's exclusive partnership with Ramp enables fast, convenient on-ramps from users' bank accounts to their accounts on Fuse by purchasing Fuse-native stablecoins, including FuseDollar.

### [Chainlink](https://chain.link)

Chainlink is a leading decentralized network of oracles for blockchain-powered applications. Chainlink's proof of reserve functionality will be used to enhance the full backing of the FuseDollar stablecoin with USDC.    

### [Pocket Network](https://pokt.network)

Pocket Network is a platform incentivizing participants to run full nodes for multiple blockchains. Fuse has become a paid network on Pocket, meaning that Pocket nodes now help route user-submitted transactions to Fuse full nodes.

### [Request Network](https://request.network)

Request Network is a platform for optimizing the processing of crypto payments by businesses. Request's core invoicing functionality is live on Fuse, enabling corporate users to easily create, manage and pay crypto invoices.  

### [Boson Protocol](https://bosonprotocol.io)

Boson Protocol is a project working on decentralizing e-commerce through the use of tokenization, including special NFTs and tokens representing units of goods \(Thing Tokens\). Fuse will integrate Boson's Thing Tokens to make them discoverable and tradable within the Fuse ecosystem. 

### [0Chain](https://0chain.net)

0Chain is a decentralized storage platform that combines on- and off-chain storage for optimal results. Fuse's integration with 0Chain is set to explore the possibility of storing Fuse payment communities' data and the metadata for NFTs on Fuse

### [Orion Protocol](https://orionprotocol.io)

Orion Protocol is a platform aiming at aggregating all the liquidity available on both centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges. Fuse will integrate Orion's Liquidity Boost plugin to provide FuseSwap traders with access to substantial exchange liquidity

### [e-Money](https://e-money.com)

e-Money is a leading provider of fully collateralized, compliant, interest-bearing stablecoins. The goal of the collaboration between Fuse and e-Money is to bring e-Money stablecoins to the Fuse ecosystem. This will be achieved through the building of a bridge between the e-Money chain and Fuse Network.

### [MANTRA DAO](https://mantradao.com)

MANTRA DAO is a community-governed DeFi platform focusing on staking, lending and governance. MANTRA DAO helps secure Fuse by running a validator node on Fuse Network. Fuse and MANTRA DAO collaborate on launching liquidity reward programs on Fuse.

### [Transak](https://transak.com)

Transak is a major fiat on-ramp provider. Fuse integrates Transak for enabling fiat on-ramps in the jurisdictions where Ramp Network services are not available for Fuse users. 

### [Moneri](https://monerium.com)u[m](https://ichi.org)

Monerium enables the issuance of tokenized electronic money on the blockchain. Unlike stablecoins, e-money is backed by funds on users' bank accounts opened with Monerium. The goal of the collaboration is to bring tokenized e-money to Fuse.

## Infrastructure/developer tools

### [Fuse Studio](https://studio.fuse.io)

Fuse Studio is a platform for issuing tokens and creating payment-focused communities around them and managing those. It enables the issuance of tokens and the creation of their associated communities in both a simplified \(no coding\) mode via the Studio website, and a more technical mode using the platform's API.

### [White Label Wallet](https://github.com/fuseio/fuse-wallet)

The Fuse White Label wallet is the second core piece of Fuse's mobile-centric payment infrastructure. It is an open-source wallet that can be freely forked and customized by any project building on top of Fuse via its API. It is build using the Flutter 2.2 framework, which makes its codebase suitable for multiple platforms, including mobile and desktop. More than 60 forks of the wallet have already been created, including Fuse Cash, CuraDAI and Peepl. The Fuse team is also working on creating an SDK for the white label wallet, enabling developers to borrow some of its components into their solutions instead of forking the whole of it.

### [The Graph](https://thegraph.com)

The Graph is a decentralized protocol enabling convenient indexing of the data generated by smart contracts and other decentralized protocols like IPFS through the creation of subgraphs. Fuse uses subgraphs for platform components such as The Studio. In addition, any developer can create a subgraph on Fuse for their decentralized application.

FuseDollar \(fUSD\) is the first Fuse-native stablecoin. fUSD is minted by locking an equal amount of USDC stablecoins, which means that fUSD is 100% collateralized by USDC. fUSD can be conveniently purchased from almost anywhere in the world thanks to the integration with Ramp Network. It is also an interest-bearing asset, as it is possible to earn 5% APR by holding it on a Fuse Cash wallet account.

### [oneFUSE](https://medium.com/fusenet/fuse-partners-with-ichi-to-launch-onefuse-stablecoin-for-the-fuse-community-8ed52ef1229b)

oneFUSE is an innovative stablecoin for the Fuse community created by ICHI. It is a hybrid stablecoin backed partly by USDC and partly by FUSE tokens. In order to issue 1 oneFUSE, a user must deposit $1 in USDC and FUSE, according to the proportion in place at the time of minting.
