# Deploying Smart Contracts

Getting your dApp live on Fuse is simple:

* Replace the generic RPC address with a Fuse-specific one for targeted deployment.

[Please see the RPC page for more details.](../../understanding-fuse/getting-started-with-fuse/network-details.md)

* The network id must be updated.
* Switch the Default Network to Fuse
