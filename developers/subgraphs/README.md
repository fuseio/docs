# Subgraphs

The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, starting with Ethereum. It makes it possible to query data that is difficult to query directly. Read more about the graph protocol in the [official documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/).

## Available options

* The Graph is available on the Fuse Network via the [Hosted Service](the-graph-hosted-service.md)
* Another hosting solution for graphs is [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)
* Developers can always operate and maintain their own [graph node](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/operating-graph-node/)
