# Getting Started

Before you start using the Fuse Wallet Flutter SDK, you must complete a few prerequisites. Once you have completed these prerequisites, you must install and configure the Fuse Wallet SDK in your application.

* Flutter: version 2.0 or higher
* Dart: version 2.19 or higher
* A Charge account and an associated API key

Installing Flutter and Dart is a straightforward process; you can find detailed instructions on the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) website. Once you have installed Flutter and Dart, you must create a Charge account if you don't already have one. After creating your account, you will be able to generate an API key that you can use to access the Charge Smart Wallets API.

Once you have installed the prerequisites and generated your API key, you can use the Charge Smart Wallets SDK for Flutter/Dart.
