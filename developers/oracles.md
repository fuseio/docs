# Oracles

Blockchain oracles are third-party services that provide data to smart contracts running on a blockchain network. Oracles act as intermediaries between the blockchain network and the outside world, enabling smart contracts to execute based on real-world events or data.

## DIA

DIA is a blockchain project that provides decentralized oracles for financial and economic data. DIA's oracles enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that require real-time, high-quality financial data, without the need for a centralized data provider. Read more about DIA on their [website](https://www.diadata.org/) and [documentation](https://docs.diadata.org/).

Check the list of [price feeds](https://docs.diadata.org/documentation/oracle-documentation/deployed-contracts#fuse) available on the Fuse Network.

## Chainlink

A centralized version on Chainlink data feeds will be launched soon.
