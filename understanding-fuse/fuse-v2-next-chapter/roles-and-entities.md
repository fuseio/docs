# Roles and Entities

### Roles and Entities

In Fuse 2.0, we introduce the following roles and entities directly or indirectly involved in the ecosystem.

### Operators&#x20;

Operators are real-world business applications, games, dApps, and anything that could run on the Fuse stack.&#x20;

They develop and maintain applications that involve payments, are responsible for the seamless onboarding of users to the applications on Fuse, support their users, and follow the corresponding local regulations where they operate.&#x20;

Operators cover most of the payment-related fees in the network. They are businesses that build products and services that utilize the network for their clients.

### Users

End-users of the applications developed, managed, and maintained by the Operators. They want to pay for products and services. They are not blockchain experts or tech-savvy.

### Merchants

End-users that use the network capabilities to the fullest would be merchants. Merchants require on/off ramping locally anywhere in the world. They will use out-of-the-box services such as accounting and invoicing point of sale and eCommerce plugins.

An L1 like Fuse is well situated to provide a truly global service. Merchants will also use the out-of-the-box services on Fuse, like accounting, invoicing, POS, eCommerce, etc.

### Power Validators

PVS run and maintain the payment infrastructure that Operators use to facilitate payments. Every entity on the network is represented with a Smart Wallet Contract. The smart contracts enable extra functionality that can be injected via [payment primitives](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LdmeTBjede0-BcSd0W0/s/goUiB6chXvy8iVhpHHNd/understanding-fuse/fuse-v2-next-chapter/payment-primitives).
