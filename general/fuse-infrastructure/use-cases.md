# Fuse Mobile Infrastructure Use Cases

Given its easily customizable character, Fuse's mobile-centric infrastracture for issuing tokens and creating communities around them has a wide range of potential applications.

Companies and other organizations can use either Fuse Studio or Fuse Studio in conjunction with a customized version of Fuse Wallet to 

In what follows, we would like to provide a few already proven use cases for illustration.

## A Festival Payments Token

In November 2020, Bitazza used Fuse Studio to issue the [MYST](https://explorer.fuse.io/address/0x510FAD1AD23064Ae881B129314EFdD9FDa6d4782/transactions) payments token on Fuse Network for the Mystic Valley Festival in Thailand. They also forked Fuse Wallet to create a customized mobile app for the festival. 

The app and token seamlessly powered the more than 15 thousand transactions made by attendees during the 3-day event. 

Fuse's mobile infrastructure can help event organizers reduce costs of managing internal payments and significantly improve the customer experience by replacing legacy solutions such as physical payment tokens or refillable cards.

## A Solution for Streamlining Charitable Donations

The Communitaria project \(formerly, Wikibank\) has benefited from the Fuse B2B technology to solve an important problem in the charity industry. It launched a token backed one-to-one by the donated funds that can only be spent by the beneficiaries using the project's mobile app. The tokens can only be used for payment at the participating shops selling fresh produce.

This has allowed Communitaria to reassure the donors that the funds they provide can only be used for the stated goal: enabling the beneficiaries to buy fresh food. Other NGOs and charitable projects can also target their donations better and more transparently by using the Fuse technology.
