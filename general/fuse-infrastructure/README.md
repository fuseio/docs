# Fuse Mobile-Centric B2B Infrastructure

The Fuse Network platform differs from many other public blockchain platforms in that it includes an open-source mobile-centric plug-and-play infrastructure for crypto payments and DeFi.

The infrastructure currently consists of two major elements:

1\) The **Fuse Studio** platform and API for creating and managing token-powered communities on Fuse.

2\) The **Fuse Wallet technology** for creating mobile wallets interoperable with Fuse Studio and the communities created through it.
