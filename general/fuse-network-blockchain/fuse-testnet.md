# Fuse Network's Spark Testnet

Like other public blockchains, Fuse Network has a constantly running [testnet](https://fusespark.io/) called Spark. It has the same network protocol and block interval as the mainnet.  

It can be used by developers wishing to deploy their dApps in a safe and costless mode, first. 

It is also used to test network protocol updates, as well as validator node and full node software updates
