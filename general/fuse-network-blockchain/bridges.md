# Bridges to Other Chains

The Fuse team strongly believes in a future with multiple interoperable blockchains, without a single chain being dominant.

This makes it important for Fuse Network to be connected to as many major blockchain platforms as feasible. 

Currently, it is connected via two-way bridges to Ethereum \(mainnet\) and Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\). Both bridges are accessible via the [interface](https://fuseswap.com/#/bridge) of the Fuse-native DEX FuseSwap. They currently support FUSE and ERC20 tokens, including ERC wrappers for major native blockchain tokens such as ETH, BTC and BNB.

A key feature of both of these bridges is that users sending tokens on them receive the right version of the relevant token on the destination chain instead of a different wrapper token. This reduces a lot of friction for the users sending tokens to and from Fuse Network.

The current Fuse bridges are also custodial, meaning that the bridge operator are in control of the funds being bridged and can revert transfers. While a non-custodial bridging solution is, in theory, more desirable, in practice, non-custodial bridges built with currently available technology carry unacceptably high security risks.

On both bridges, sending tokens from the relevant blockchain to Fuse Network is not subject to any fees or limits. Token withdrawals from Fuse incur a 0.5% fee on the amount bridged.   

### Fuse-Ethereum Bridge

The Fuse-Ethereum bridge supports a wide range of ERC20 tokens, including WETH, WBTC, LINK, GRT, USDC, USDT, KNC, LRC, etc. 

The minimum value of tokens that can be bridged from Fuse to Ethereum is USD 1000.

### Fuse-BSC Bridge  

Fuse Network is also connected via a two-way broidge to Binance Smart Chain. Currently, the Fuse-BSC bridge supports a more limited set of tokens than its Ethereum counterpart: WBNB, WETH and FUSE.

The minimum value of tokens that can be bridged from Fuse to BSC is USD 200.

### Other potential bridges

The Fuse team is consistently working on adding both bridges to other major EVM-compatible blockchains through integrations with reputable bridge service providers.
