# Scaling. Flutter Layer 2 Payments

Scalability is a challenge faced by all public blockchains, and Fuse Network is no exception. Although, currently, the Fuse Network blockchain is far from being saturated by the incoming transactions the project team is keenly aware that this may change at any moment. 

Hence, research has been ongoing into the potential options for boosting the scalability of Fuse without significantly sacrificing decentralization and security. 

The scaling solution most likely to be implemented on Fuse first will be Flutter Layer 2 payments \(FL2P\) \[&lt;-LINK\]. 

This approach to scaling relies on the technology called [zero-knowledge \(ZK\) rollup](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/). It involves processing most of the transactions within a ZK-enabled second layer environment and periodically batching or 'rolling up' transactions as a single ZK proof on the Layer 1 blockchain.

FL2P is an SDK that enables developers to integrate the \[WHICH?\] ZK rollup directly into mobile crypto wallet software. As Fuse's ecosystem is mobile-centric, the integration of FL2P into the Fuse wallet technology will allow scaling a lion's share of the network transactions.
