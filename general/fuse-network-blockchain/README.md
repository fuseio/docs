# The Fuse Network Blockchain

## Network Overview and Key Metrics

Fuse Network is the decentralized public blockchain that powers the Fuse platform and ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of Fuse Network.

The Fuse Network blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake \(dPoS\) for achieving consensus. The consensus is secured by a significant number of validators, only one of which is run by the Fuse core team.

Validators are also responsible for the most important type of governance on Fuse, namely, adopting the network protocol changes. 

The native token of the network is called FUSE. New FUSE tokens are issued with every added block and are also use to pay for gas, just like ETH on Ethereum. 

The Fuse Network blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on Fuse is around 5 seconds, and it currently costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.

In its present capacity, the Fuse Network blockchain is capable of processing around 120 native token transfers and 60 ERC20 token transfers per second. The faster processing of native token transfers is due to the fact that they do not involve computations run on the network's virtual machine.
