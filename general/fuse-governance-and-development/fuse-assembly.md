# Fuse Assembly

Fuse Assembly is a governance body formed from particularly active members of the Fuse community. Its formation is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the Fuse platform to the community. &#x20;

Currently, Fuse Assembly consists of five Fuse ecosystem members independent from Fuse Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project, and already have a voice within the community.

Fuse Assembly's **current role includes the following**:&#x20;

* taking over the control over the [Fuse Forum](https://forum.fuse.io) community discussion platform;
* implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on Fuse; and
* managing the Community Token Pool.

## Community Token Pool

Fuse Assembly's budget will be initially constituted by the **Community Token Pool**. Each month, **200,000 FUSE** will be allocated to it from the Fuse Bootstrap Pool (discussed [here](https://docs.fuse.io/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)).

Fuse Assembly will regularly distribute the Community Token Pool funds to finance grants, bounties, marketing, and other initiatives designed to serve communities building on the platform and drive innovation. &#x20;
