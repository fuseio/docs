# Fuse Governance and Development

Fuse is already a significantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Fuse Network validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [Fuse improvement proposals](https://docs.fuse.io/general/fips) \(FIPs\).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **Fuse Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Fuse treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis FUSE supply \(see the subsection "[FUSE Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.fuse.io/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)"\) are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For Fuse, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company Fuse Network Limited.

Fuse Foundation employs the Fuse project team whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://fuse.io/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on Fuse. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the Fuse tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.

That said, since Fuse is a decentralized platform, **no permission of the project team is required** for anyone who wishes to integrate with or develop on top of Fuse. The project team's role is only to facilitate and coordinate.

3\) **Fuse Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://docs.fuse.io/general/fuse-governance/fuse-assembly) for more details.
