# Fuse Rewards Platform

The [Fuse Rewards platform](https://rewards.fuse.io) is an online gateway for the members of the Fuse community wishing to participate in the yield earning programs. 

Currently, the programs featured there reward users who provide liquidity to the major DEX pools involving the FUSE token on DEXes on Fuse Network, Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

Users who have provided liquidity on one of the eligible pools can use the Fuse Rewards platform to deposit their LP tokens and later withdraw them to receive the accumulated rewards.

The platform supports WalletConnect which makes it accessible with WalletConnect-enabled wallets on Fuse, including Fuse Cash and MetaMask Mobile.
