# FuseSwap DEX

[FuseSwap](https://fuseswap.com) is the first Fuse-native automated market maker \(AMM\)-based decentralized exchange. 

It is based on a fork of Uniswap V2 but features much faster and cheaper transactions than the latter. 

Among other tokens, wrapped versions of major cryptocurrencies are available for trading on FuseSwap, including ETH, BTC, LINK, GRT, USDC, USDT, etc.   

Projects can plug in to the FuseSwap API and integrate FuseSwap into their applications, just like FuseSwap is accessible in-app in the Fuse Cash wallet.
