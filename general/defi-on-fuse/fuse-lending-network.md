# Fuse Lending Network and the Ola Finance Protocol

[Fuse Lending Network](https://app.ola.finance/networks/0x5809FAB2Bf39efae6DD8691B7F90c468c234A1A7/markets) is the first decentralized lending network on top of Fuse. It is the fruit of the collaboration between Fuse and Ola Finance

It currently supports 4 crypto assets on both the supply and the borrow side: WBTC, WETH, USDC and FUSE.

Users wishing to borrow funds from the network must, first, deposit a sufficient amount of collateral. Each of the assets has its own collateral ratio.

Network participants on both the supply and borrow side automatically participate in the Rainmaker liquidity rewards program that enables them to earn yield in exchange for their contribution.

## The Ola Finance Protocol   

Fuse Lending Network is the first implementation of the [Ola Finance](https://ola.finance) protocol. It enables anyone to build a customized decentralized lending network with its own set of supported assets and its own rules and governance.

Projects building on top of Fuse can, thus, create their own lending networks to bolster the adoption of their tokens and drive community engagement.
