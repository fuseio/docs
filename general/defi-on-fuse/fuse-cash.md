# Fuse Cash Consumer-Facing Wallet

[Fuse Cash](https://fuse.cash) is a consumer-facing mobile crypto wallet running on top of Fuse Network.

It is the Fuse team's own proof-of-concept implementation of the Fuse Wallet technology, so it inherits all the important core features all Fuse wallet forks have. In other words, it is a smart-contract-based non-custodial wallet with fee abstraction, directly connected to the Fuse Studio backend. Fuse Cash users form a community on the Studio whose underlying token is FuseDollar \(fUSD\).

Fuse Cash boasts the following important features:

1\) **Fee-free fiat on-ramp**. Thanks to the integration with Ramp Network, users from almost anywhere in the world can quickly deposit fUSD into their Fuse Cash accounts from their bank accounts.

2\) **In-app DEX integration**. Fuse Cash users can trade on the FuseSwap DEX directly from the Fuse Cash interface. 

3\) **WalletConnect functionality**. Fuse Cash is a WalletConnect-enabled wallet which allows users to use it to interact with DeFi applications on Fuse. The latter currently include FuseSwap and the Fuse Rewards platform.

4\) **5% APR on fUSD**. Users holding fUSD on their Fuse Cash accounts automatically participate in the fUSD rewards pool which allows them to earn 5% APR on their fUSD holdings.        


Fuse Cash is thus both an unstoppable bank account and a gateway to DeFi on Fuse.
