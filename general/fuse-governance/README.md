# Fuse Governance

Fuse is a decentralized platform. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [Fuse improvement proposals](https://docs.fuse.io/general/fips) \(FIPs\).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **Fuse Foundation**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Fuse treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis FUSE supply \(see the subsection "[FUSE Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.fuse.io/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)"\) are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For Fuse, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company Fuse Network Limited.

Fuse Foundation employs the Fuse project team whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://fuse.io/about).

3\) **Fuse Assembly.** See the next page for more details.
