# Fuse Ecosystem

The Fuse ecosystem has seen massive growth since the launch of the platform in 2019. It consists of the following key elements:

1\) **Basic infrastructure**. This category includes:&#x20;

* Fuse-operated tools like the Fuse RPC, Fuse Explorer, Fuse Staking, etc.
* Fuse's mobile-centric B2B infrastructure enabling corporate clients to create token-powered applications and on-board clients via mobile wallets and apps.&#x20;
* Other basic infrastructure providers like Pocket Network (decentralized full node layer), Chainlink and DIA (oracles)
* Fiat on- and off-ramps, including, among others, Ramp Network, XanPool and Transak.

2\) **Interoperability tools**. This includes multichain bridge and inter-chain transfer protocols, such as Multichain (previously Anyswap), Connext, the Voltage bridge, Elk Finance and others.

3\) **Payment-focused applications built on top of Fuse's B2B infrastructure**. These include, among others, Peepl, GoodDollar, Kolektivo, Comunitaria and Flambu.

4\) **Centralized and decentralized exchanges** where Fuse's native FUSE token and other Fuse-powered assets are traded. The most prominent of those are Gate.io, MEXC and&#x20;

5\) DeFi and NFT tools. The DeFi space on Fuse is led by the community-governed Voltage Finance (formerly FuseFi) platform. Other major platforms include Sushi, Beefy Finance, &#x20;
