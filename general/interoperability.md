  Fuse Network blockchain.

# Interoperability

The Fuse team strongly believes in interoperability among public blockchains. No single platform is likely to become fully dominant in the future.

Hence, interoperability solutions enabling transfers between Fuse and other blockchains are vital for the continued growth of the Fuse platform and ecosystem.&#x20;

The Fuse team has been making considerable progress in getting Fuse Network added by the leading operators. Currently the Fuse Network blockchain is connected to other blockchains via the following multichain bridges and value transfer protocols:

1\) The FuseFi bridge.

2\) The Elk Finance value transfer protool.

3\) The Connext bridge (available to users via the xPollinate interface).

4\) The Multichain (formerly, Anyswap) bridge.

5\) The ChainPort bridge.

### The FuseFi Bridge

The FuseFi bridge was created by the Fuse team and has been transferred to the FuseFi platform that will soon be governed by the FuseFi DAO.&#x20;

It connects Fuse Network to **Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. Both bridges are custodial. The bridge to Ethereum is permissionless, while new tokens need to be added to the BSC bridge.

On both bridges, sending tokens from the relevant blockchain to Fuse Network is not subject to any fees or limits. Token withdrawals from Fuse incur a **0.05% fee** on the amount bridged. Users transferring funds also need to pay the fees on the destination chain in order to claim their tokens from the bridge contract at the final stage of the transfer. &#x20;

The bridge can be accessed via the FuseFi app. More information on its functioning can be found here. The FuseFi bridging tutorials are available [here](https://tutorials.fuse.io/tutorials/bridge-tutorials).&#x20;

### The Elk Finance Value Transfer Platform

Elk Finance is not a typical multichain bridge because the only token that actually moves between the supported chains is ELK. If a user wants to get tokens on another chain, they can buy ELK on Elk DEX on Fuse bridge ELK to the desired chain and buy the desired token on Elk DEX on that chain.

Elk connects Fuse Network, among others, to **BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony, Moonriver**. It does not currently support Ethereum. The full list of supported chains is available in the [Elk DApp](https://app.elk.finance).&#x20;

### The Connext Bridge

Connext is a non-custodial multichain bridge that connects Fuse Network to **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom, Moonriver and xDAI**.

The Connext bridge is currently accessible directly via the [xPollinate](https://xpollinate.io) interface. It can also be integrated into DApps.

**Please note** that Connext's capacity to execute transfers depends on the availability of liquidity in a given token on the routers. Currently, the provisioned tokens include **WETH, USDC, USDT and DAI**.

### The Multichain (formerly Anyswap) Bridge

### The ChainPort Bridge

ChainPort's bridges are permissionless. This means that anyone can bridge a token from Ethereum to any other supported chain (including Fuse Network), even if the token has not been ported, yet.&#x20;

**IMPORTANT!!!** Please note that ChainPort currently only supports transfers of tokens that originate on the Ethereum mainnet. Also, ChainPort's wrappers on Fuse for the **popular Ethereum-originating tokens such as USDC, WETH, USDT, etc**. will by design be different from the currently existing ones that were created using the FuseFi bridge. **We currently do not recommend users to bridge those tokens to Fuse using ChainPort**.  &#x20;
