**Step 1:** Please make sure that you have installed the latest version of Ethereum app on your Ledger as shown below.

**Step 5:** Now that you have logged in to your address in Ledger through MyEtherWallet on Fuse network, you can see your Fuse address \(Fusenet\), balance, etc.

**Now let’s learn how to stake FUSE.**

**Step 6:** Click on **“Contract”** and then click on Interact with contract and

1. Enter the consensus contract address **0x3014ca10b91cb3D0AD85fEf7A3Cb95BCAc9c0f79**
2. Copy the consensus ABI from below link

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuseio/fuse-network/master/abis/Consensus\_abi.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuseio/fuse-network/master/abis/Consensus_abi.json)

Click on **“Continue”**.

**Step 7:**

From the drop down select the **“Delegate”** function and then copy the “**Validator address”** from the staking UI. Enter the amount of FUSE you want to stake under **“Value in ETH”** and click on **“Write”**. In the below example I have copied ”Liquify” validators address to stake.

Review and confirm the transaction on your Ledger. Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain it means you have staked your FUSE successfully.

Now lets learn to withdraw the staked FUSE.

**Step 8**: Follow Step 1 to Step 6 from above.

From the drop down select the **“Withdraw”** function and then copy the “**Validator address”** from the staking UI to which you have delegated your stake. Enter the amount of FUSE you want to stake under **“\_amount\(uint256\)”, “value in ETH”** should be 0 and click on **“Write”**.

Review and confirm the transaction on your Ledger. Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain it means you have unstaked your FUSE successfully.
