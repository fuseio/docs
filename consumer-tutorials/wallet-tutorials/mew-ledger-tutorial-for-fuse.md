**Step 6: FUSE** is already present in the default list of tokens on MEW. You just have to search **FUSE** on the right hand side \(as shown below\) to view your **FUSE** balance on that particular Ethereum address.

Now let’s learn how to Send/Receive **FUSE** on MEW.

**To receive FUSE:** Once completing Steps 1-6, Click **“Copy address”** button just below your “Address” \(Public key\) as highlighted below. This is the address to which you can receive FUSE and can be viewed on your MEW once confirmed on-chain.

**To send FUSE:** Click on **“Send Transaction”** and when you have **FUSE** in your wallet you should be able to select **“FUSE”** from the **“Type”** drop down. Enter the **“Amount”** you want to send as well as the **“To Address”** to which you want to transfer **FUSE**. You can also click **“Edit”** if you want to change gas prices. Once you have entered all the details click on **“Send Transaction”.** Now you should get a popup on your ledger device to approve the transaction. After approving physically on the Ledger device the final confirmation screen will appear showing all the details
