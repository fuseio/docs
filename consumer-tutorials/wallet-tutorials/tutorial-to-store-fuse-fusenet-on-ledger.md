Enter the **“Amount”** you want to send as well as the **“To address”** to which you want to transfer **FUSE**. Once you have entered all the details click on **“Send Transaction”.** Now you should get a popup on your ledger device to approve the transaction. After approving physically on the Ledger device the final confirmation screen will appear showing all the details
