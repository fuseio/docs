# Fuse overview

### What is the Fuse network?

The Fuse network is a permissionless and border-less public ledger designed for easy integration of everyday payments. It's anchored to Ethereum using a bridge which allows any token to freely move between Ethereum and the Fuse-chain.  A Token is minted on Ethereum and then moved to the Fuse-chain, where it gets access to a wide range of features and business plugins that brings it to life.

User data in the Fuse network is stored by the users on their devices and they decide who to share it with using standard web3.0 interfaces. The users can join communities and community contracts define their data and governance policies. Those communities can be governed by individuals or organizations, everything is public and transparent on the blockchain.

The Fuse Studio allows users to easily launch and operate new communities, with a built in contract store that allows the easy launch of new features and integrated services - fiat on-ramps, business management plugins, community management functionality and much more.
